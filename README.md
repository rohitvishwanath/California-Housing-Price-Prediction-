# California Housing Price Prediction | Machine Learning Mini Project

A machine learning project that applies **Linear Regression** to predict housing prices using the **California Housing dataset**. This project demonstrates a complete ML workflow including data analysis, model training, and performance evaluation using real-world data.

## Project Highlights
- End-to-end machine learning pipeline (EDA → Model → Evaluation)
- Implemented **Linear Regression** using Scikit-learn
- Used real-world housing data for regression analysis
- Evaluated model performance with industry-standard metrics

## Dataset
- **Source:** Scikit-learn (California Housing Dataset)
- **Target Variable:** Median House Value
- **Features:** Income, housing age, rooms, population, latitude, longitude, etc.

## Machine Learning Model
- **Algorithm:** Linear Regression  
- **Train-Test Split:** Applied for model validation  
- **Library:** Scikit-learn  

## Model Performance
The model was evaluated using:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R² Score**

These metrics indicate how accurately the model predicts housing prices and how well it generalizes to unseen data.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Regression modeling and evaluation
- Python-based data analysis
- Machine learning using Scikit-learn
- Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **NumPy, Pandas**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
